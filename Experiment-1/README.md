## Experiment 1 â€“ LED, Buzzer, and Servo Control with Pushbutton

### Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- 1 x LED (with resistor)
- 1 x Pushbutton
- 1 x Buzzer (active/passive)
- 1 x Servo motor
- Jumper wires, breadboard

### Circuit Connections
- LED â†’ Pin 9
- Buzzer â†’ Pin 8
- Servo Signal â†’ Pin 6
- Pushbutton â†’ Pin 7 (INPUT_PULLUP)
- GND and 5V as required

### Working
1. When pushbutton is pressed:
   - LED blinks **3 times** (1s ON, 0.5s OFF).
   - Buzzer beeps **2 times** (1s ON, 1s OFF).
   - Servo rotates to **45Â°**, holds for 1s, then returns to 0Â°.

2. When pushbutton is not pressed:
   - LED OFF, Buzzer OFF, Servo stays at 0Â°.
